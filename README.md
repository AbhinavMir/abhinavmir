Looking for Part time gigs / full-time contracts / internships for summer '23. 

**Currently**: 
**MS Computer Science @ Boston University,** '24 <br>
Did grad-level networking, databases and object-oriented programming last semester where I became decently good with Java. <br>
This semester is all about network sec + crypto, practical cybersecurity and game theory - the new three things I am absolutely obsessed about.

**Previous life**:
- Engineer @ [Ignite Tournaments](https://www.ignitetournaments.com/): Writing solidity, testing with hardhat, scoping bugs and gas golfing, running an EVM node on GCP, it was all fun stuff!
- <a href="http://defialliance.co/">DeFi Alliance</a> as a Software Engineer: Co-developed [web3grants.co](https://www.web3grants.co/), but it seems like it's not maintained anymore. I was there for 4 months.
- At <a href="https://persistence.one">Persistence</a> before that as a Blockchain Research intern.
- Fellow @ Ethereum India Foundation
