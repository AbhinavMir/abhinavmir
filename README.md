## Projects

- [ThoughtForest](https://www.thoughtforest.xyz/)
  - Built solo in 2 weeks with React and Django
  - Uses Planetscale for the database
  - Backend and frontend deployed to Render and Vercel (Initially I was using DigitalOcean droplets, but ran out of credits)
- [Sol2Huff](https://github.com/abhinavmir/sol2huff) - A Solidity to Huff transpiler.
- [Eclair](https://github.com/abhinavmir/eclair) - A tool to create Python, Rust, and TS/JS library wrappers around Blockchain Business Logic code instantly.
- [SDSA-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sdsa-lib/base) - A library for Solidity data structures and algorithms - ships in base flavor, but variants can be built on top.
- [Spock](https://spock.tools/) - A cryptographically-secure passwordless login method for the web.
- [Wastebin](https://github.com/AbhinavMir/wastebin) - A replacement for the `rm` utility tool with a better management system.
- [Web3grants.co](https://www.web3grants.co/) - A full-stack website built with NodeJS, PostgreSQL, and ReactJS for aggregating grants and fellowships in the Crypto space.
- [DosaDB](https://github.com/abhinavmir/databases) - A simple database with a query parser, and the usual complex internal functions. Developed in Python. Built for educational purposes.
- [SolDoc](https://github.com/AbhinavMir/solDoc) - A JavaDoc-like tooling for Solidity (An object-oriented statically typed language for backends on the Ethereum Network).
- [Metapoly](https://github.com/abhinavmir/metapoly) - Monopoly on Blockchain. Used Object-Oriented programming via Solidity to develop a rather complex game system.
- [A Cybersecurity risk audit of "Phuture"](https://hackmd.io/@abhinavmir/phuture) - A financial index tracking instrument to allow users to passively invest in Crypto (via code4arena).

**Previous life**:
- Engineer @ [Ignite Tournaments](https://www.ignitetournaments.com/): Writing solidity, testing with hardhat, scoping bugs and gas golfing, running an EVM node on GCP, it was all fun stuff!
- <a href="http://defialliance.co/">DeFi Alliance</a> as a Software Engineer: Co-developed [web3grants.co](https://www.web3grants.co/), but it seems like it's not maintained anymore. I was there for 4 months.
- At <a href="https://persistence.one">Persistence</a> before that as a Blockchain Research intern.
- Fellow @ Ethereum India Foundation
